A program that displays a 3D model and an animation.

This program requires FreeGLUT (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net).

The model is read from a standard obj file. You can create your own model using Blender (http://www.blender.org). There is no support for textures.

The animation is read from a custom anim file. In this project you will find this format's specification. An anim file contains a series of keyframs that will be used to generate a 3D path using linear or quadratic interpolation.
