Anim File Specification
By Ian Esteves do Nascimento, 2013

An anim file contains keyframes for an animation.

Each line begins with an id of what that line contains:
- frame :    New keyframe.
             Followed by an integer value.
- pos :      Position of the object on that frame.
             Followed by three real values.
- rotAxis :  Axis in which the object will rotate around.
             Followed by three real values.
- rotAngle : Angle of rotation, in degrees.
             Followed by one real value.
- scale :    The model will be stretched this amount in all
             directions. A value of 1.0 means the model
             will appear the same size.
             Followed by one real value.
